# ðŸŒ¿ Smart Garden IoT Project ðŸŒ¿

Welcome to the Smart Garden IoT Project! This project leverages cutting-edge IoT technology to create an intelligent gardening system that monitors and manages various environmental factors to ensure optimal plant growth. Whether you're a hobbyist gardener or a professional, this project aims to make gardening easier and more efficient.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Water Pump Control**: Automated water pump to ensure your plants get the right amount of water.
- **TDS Sensor**: Measures the total dissolved solids in the water, helping to maintain optimal nutrient levels.
- **DHT Sensor**: Monitors temperature and humidity, ensuring the environment is perfect for plant growth.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Measures the water level in the reservoir to prevent the pump from running dry.
- **PH Meter**: Monitors the pH level of the water to keep it within the ideal range for your plants.
- **Relay Module**: Controls the water pump and other devices based on sensor data.
